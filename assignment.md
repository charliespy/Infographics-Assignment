## Assignment Prompt

Infographics are visual representations of information. They can include numbers, text, images, or any combination of the three. For this infographic assignment, please **explain how colonialism, imperialism, globalization, and/or militarism have impacted migration and/or (re)produced racial, sexual, gender, class, and global inequalities/hierarchies**. Since the point of an infographic is to transfer knowledge and information quickly, the final poster should be informative, simple, engaging, and design-friendly. Be attentive to the order or flow of information.

## Specifications

The infographic needs to **visually communicate**: (1) a thesis/main argument; (2) creative data representation (using charts, graphs, diagrams, flowcharts, maps, etc.) that supports the thesis, with proper citations of referenced materials; and (3) a conclusion.

**Required content:**

- a title
- eye-catching section headings
- intentional color selection to advance your argument
- a minimum of **1 original** graph, chart, or table that you created yourself
- a minimum of **4 graphics** that amplify your argument
- concise text to make and connect your arguments

Cite at least **three credible sources**, one of which must be from an assigned reading in **Unit 3**. Citations should appear in the footer of the infographic or some other discreet place, so that the sources can easily be checked.

Infographics should **fit on a single page**.

## Infographic Structure

Use these sections in order. **Introduction** = thesis/main argument; **Thematic sections** = data representation + citations; **Conclusion** = conclusion.

### 1. Introduction (thesis/main argument)

State your main argument or thesis in one or two paragraphs. What is the central claim? What forces or policies are you linking? What outcome are you explaining?

### 2. Historical Context / Background (optional but recommended)

Give a short timeline or set of key events. Key dates and brief labels so the reader can follow cause and effect.

### 3. Thematic Sections (main body)

Break your argument into **2–4 thematic sections**. Each section: narrative text + at least one data visualization (chart, graph, map, table). Use clear section titles that match your themes.

### 4. Conclusion

Tie the argument together in one or two paragraphs. Restate how the forces you described lead to the outcomes; optionally note ongoing effects or implications.

### 5. References

List all sources in a consistent citation style (e.g. MLA). Place at the end of the infographic.

### 6. Description (optional)

Short reflection: what each part of the infographic is meant to show, and what you learned.
