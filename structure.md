title: Infographic Structure
---

This assignment uses the **same section structure** as the example infographics (e.g. *U.S. Militarism on Guam*, *The Ripple Effects of U.S. Imperialism on Central American Migration*, and *Militarism's Toll: The Vietnamese Diaspora and its Path to the US*). Use these sections in order when you create your infographic.

---

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose:** State your main argument or thesis in one or two paragraphs.

- What is the central claim?
- What forces or policies are you linking (e.g. U.S. militarism, imperialism, economic policy)?
- What outcome are you explaining (e.g. migration, displacement, return migration)?

*Example (Guam):* “In cementing a foundation of defense in the West Pacific, the U.S. military implemented sociopolitical and economic policies on Guam… creating a perceived substantial dependence… In producing asymmetrical opportunities… the U.S. produced the migration of Guam’s indigenous inhabitants from the island to the United States.”  

*Example (Central America):* “I argue that U.S. imperialism and militarism in Central America… have resulted in large-scale migration through the destabilization of local economies and the perpetuation of violence. Additionally, economic policies like NAFTA… have further exacerbated these issues.”

---

## 2. Historical Context / Background (optional but recommended)

**Purpose:** Give a short timeline or set of key events so readers understand when and how the story unfolds.

- Key dates (e.g. Treaty of Paris 1898, Civil War periods, policy start dates).
- Brief labels so the reader can follow cause and effect.

Use a timeline, key dates list, or a short narrative—whatever fits your topic.

---

## 3. Thematic Sections (main body)

**Purpose:** Break your argument into **2–4 thematic sections**. Each section should have:

- **Narrative text** that explains one part of your argument.
- **Data visualizations** (charts, graphs, maps, tables) that support that part.

**Naming:** Use clear section titles that match your themes, for example:

- *Guam:* Material & Discursive Militarism → education, land, migration waves, military service, economy, political status.
- *Central America:* (1) Civil Wars (El Salvador / Guatemala), (2) Return migration & deportations, (3) NAFTA & economic displacement.

Each section should make one main point and use at least one visualization to back it up.

---

## 4. Conclusion

**Purpose:** Tie the argument together in one or two paragraphs.

- Restate how the forces you described (militarism, imperialism, economic policy) lead to the outcomes (migration, return migration, displacement).
- Optionally note ongoing effects (“To this day…”) or implications.

*Example (Guam):* “To this day, Guam’s political status… limits CHamoru autonomy… Citizens of Guam today fear life without the U.S. military… yet their own democracy is compromised… CHamorus have sought to reclaim their lives… with the majority migrating to the mainland U.S.”

*Example (Central America):* “In summary, the intertwined U.S. imperialism, militarism, and a NAFTA-like economic policy have eased both migration and return migration in Central America…”

## 5. References

**Purpose:** List all sources in a consistent citation style (e.g. APA, Chicago, MLA).

- Include reports, books, articles, census data, and any other sources used for narrative and data.
- Place this section at the end of the infographic.

---

## 6. Description (optional)

**Purpose:** Short reflection or “description” of your infographic.

- What each part of the infographic is meant to show.
- What you learned (e.g. “Creating this infographic taught me how to visually communicate complex socio-political arguments…”).

*Example (Central America):* The second page is a “Description” that walks through each section and ends with a brief reflection on forced vs. voluntary migration and what they learned.
