        <p>Wars force people from their homes; military networks control where people can go; and immigration laws choose who is let in based on politics rather than need. The Vietnam War's refugee routes (Espiritu), the linked struggles of Black Americans and Palestinians under empire (Rickford), and Cold War refugee rules (Wu) each show that the same powers that push people out also shape who gets in. "Rescue" stories hide the role these powers play in causing the crisis, letting global inequality continue without question.</p>

      <h2 class="section-label">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Militarized refuge, imperialism and racial hierarchies, and immigration as geopolitical weapon show that colonialism, imperialism, militarism, and globalization actively structure migration. Wars create displacement; infrastructure channels movement; and ratives decide who belongs. Migration is a product of empire and a mechanism sustaining global inequalities. Migration should be a freedom, not be forced. This infographics tell us that we should cherish our freedom to migrate to places we wish.</p>
