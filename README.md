# Infographics Assignment

A Jekyll site for showcasing infographics, hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Local Development

### Option A: Static preview (no Ruby required)

Build the home page into `preview/index.html` and serve it locally. The preview **auto-updates** when you run the script in watch mode.

```bash
# Build once
python3 scripts/build_preview.py

# Serve (in one terminal)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Auto-rebuild on changes (in another terminal)
python3 scripts/build_preview.py --watch
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000/preview/](http://localhost:8000/preview/). Edit `index.html`, `_layouts/default.html`, `_config.yml`, or `assets/css/style.css` — the watcher will rebuild the preview so a browser refresh shows your changes.

### Option B: Full Jekyll (Ruby + Bundler)

**Prerequisites:** Ruby and Bundler installed.

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open [http://localhost:4000/Infographics-Assignment/](http://localhost:4000/Infographics-Assignment/) in your browser.

## Infographic images

The main page is a single-page infographic. Images live in `assets/images/`:

- `graphic-1-colonialism.png` — [Our World in Data: Colonialism](https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/colonialism-meant-that-for-centuries-many-territories-and-people-were-ruled-from-elsewhere)
- `graphic-2-income-inequality.png` — [Our World in Data: Global income inequality](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-and-between-country-income-inequality)
- `graphic-3-mapping-deportations.jpg` — [Mapping the "White Man's Republic"](https://mappingdeportations.com/2025/09/15/the-roots-of-immigration-control/) (featured image from project)
- `original-graphic-refugee-admissions.png` — Generated by the script below (U.S. refugee arrivals 1980–2023).

To refresh the three reference graphics (e.g. after cloning), run:

```bash
bash scripts/download_graphics.sh
```

This downloads: (1) and (2) from Our World in Data’s grapher PNG API; (3) the Mapping Deportations post featured image as JPG.

### Original chart (U.S. refugee arrivals)

The chart is built from DHS Table 13 data. To regenerate it:

```bash
# Optional: use a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate the chart
python3 scripts/build_refugee_chart.py
```

Data: `data/refugee_arrivals_1980_2023.csv` (from [DHS Yearbook Table 13](https://ohss.dhs.gov/topics/immigration/yearbook/2023/table13)). Output: `assets/images/original-graphic-refugee-admissions.png`.

### Export to PDF

To export the infographic page to a single PDF (uses your existing print styles: no header/footer, A4, margins):

```bash
# Optional: use the same venv as for the refugee chart
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

python3 scripts/export_pdf.py
```

Output: `infographic.pdf` in the project root. The script builds the preview first if needed.

## Assignment prompt and specs

The full assignment prompt, specifications, and structure are in `assignment.md` (for reference; not linked on the site).

## Adding Content

1. **Infographic images** — Drop them into `assets/images/`.
2. **New pages** — Create a Markdown file (e.g. `my-infographic.md`) in the root with front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: page
title: My Infographic
---
```

3. **Navigation** — Add the page to the `navigation` list in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
navigation:
  - title: My Infographic
    url: /my-infographic/
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push to the `main` branch.
2. In your repo settings, go to **Pages** and set the source to **Deploy from a branch** → `main` / `/ (root)`.
3. The site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/Infographics-Assignment/`.
