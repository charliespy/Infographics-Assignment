    <p>Infographics are visual representations of information. They can include numbers, text, images, or any combination of the three. For this infographic assignment, please <strong>explain how colonialism, imperialism, globalization, and/or militarism have impacted migration and/or (re)produced racial, sexual, gender, class, and global inequalities/hierarchies</strong>. Since the point of an infographic is to transfer knowledge and information quickly, the final poster should be informative, simple, engaging, and design-friendly. Be attentive to the order or flow of information.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> <a href="https://www.easel.ly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easelly</a>, <a href="https://piktochart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piktochart</a>, <a href="https://infogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infogram</a>, <a href="https://www.visme.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visme</a></p>
    <h3>Specifications</h3>
    <p>The infographic needs to <strong>visually communicate</strong>: (1) a thesis/main argument; (2) creative data representation (using charts, graphs, diagrams, flowcharts, maps, etc.) that supports the thesis, with proper citations of referenced materials; and (3) a conclusion.</p>
    <p><strong>Required content:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>a title</li>
      <li>eye-catching section headings</li>
      <li>intentional color selection to advance your argument</li>
      <li>a minimum of <strong>1 original</strong> graph, chart, or table that you created yourself</li>
      <li>a minimum of <strong>4 graphics</strong> that amplify your argument</li>
      <li>concise text to make and connect your arguments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cite at least <strong>three credible sources</strong>, one of which must be from an assigned reading in <strong>Unit 3</strong>. Citations should appear in the footer of the infographic or some other discreet place, so that the sources can easily be checked.</p>
    <p>Infographics should <strong>fit on a single page</strong>.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Infographic Structure -->
  <section class="page-block" id="structure">
    <h2 class="block-title">Infographic Structure</h2>
    <p>This assignment uses the <strong>same section structure</strong> as the example infographics (e.g. <em>U.S. Militarism on Guam</em>, <em>The Ripple Effects of U.S. Imperialism on Central American Migration</em>, and <em>Militarism's Toll: The Vietnamese Diaspora and its Path to the US</em>). Use these sections in order when you create your infographic. They map to the specs as follows: <strong>Introduction</strong> = thesis/main argument; <strong>Thematic sections</strong> = where your data representation (charts, graphs, maps, etc.) and citations go; <strong>Conclusion</strong> = conclusion.</p>

    <h3>1. Introduction (thesis/main argument)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> State your main argument or thesis in one or two paragraphs.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the central claim?</li>
      <li>What forces or policies are you linking (e.g. U.S. militarism, imperialism, economic policy)?</li>
      <li>What outcome are you explaining (e.g. migration, displacement, return migration)?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Example (Guam):</em> "In cementing a foundation of defense in the West Pacific, the U.S. military implemented sociopolitical and economic policies on Guam… creating a perceived substantial dependence… In producing asymmetrical opportunities… the U.S. produced the migration of Guam's indigenous inhabitants from the island to the United States."</p>
    <p><em>Example (Central America):</em> "I argue that U.S. imperialism and militarism in Central America… have resulted in large-scale migration through the destabilization of local economies and the perpetuation of violence. Additionally, economic policies like NAFTA… have further exacerbated these issues."</p>

    <h3>2. Historical Context / Background (optional but recommended)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Give a short timeline or set of key events so readers understand when and how the story unfolds.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Key dates (e.g. Treaty of Paris 1898, Civil War periods, policy start dates).</li>
      <li>Brief labels so the reader can follow cause and effect.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use a timeline, key dates list, or a short narrative—whatever fits your topic.</p>

    <h3>3. Thematic Sections (main body — data representation + citations)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Break your argument into <strong>2–4 thematic sections</strong>. Each section should have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Narrative text</strong> that explains one part of your argument.</li>
      <li><strong>Data visualizations</strong> (charts, graphs, maps, tables) that support that part.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Naming:</strong> Use clear section titles that match your themes (e.g. Guam: Material & Discursive Militarism; Central America: Civil Wars, Return migration & deportations, NAFTA & economic displacement). Each section should make one main point and use at least one visualization.</p>

    <h3>4. Conclusion</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Tie the argument together in one or two paragraphs (the conclusion required by the specs). Restate how the forces you described lead to the outcomes; optionally note ongoing effects or implications.</p>

    <h3>5. References</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> List all sources in a consistent citation style. Include reports, books, articles, census data. Place at the end of the infographic.</p>

    <h3>6. Description (optional)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Short reflection: what each part of the infographic is meant to show, and what you learned.</p>

    <h3>Section order</h3>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Section</th><th>Required</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Introduction</td><td>Yes</td><td>Thesis / main argument</td></tr>

    <h3>Required content checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Title</li>
      <li>Eye-catching section headings</li>
      <li>Intentional color selection</li>
      <li>At least <strong>1 original</strong> graph, chart, or table (created by you)</li>
      <li>At least <strong>4 graphics</strong> that amplify the argument</li>
      <li>Concise text</li>
      <li>At least <strong>3 credible sources</strong>, <strong>one from Unit 3</strong>; citations in footer or discreet place</li>

    <h2 class="block-title">Sample: U.S. Militarism on Guam</h2>
    <p class="infographic-subtitle">A sample infographic using the assignment structure</p>

    <div class="infographic-intro">
      <h3 class="section-label">Introduction</h3>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>In cementing a foundation of defense in the West Pacific, the U.S. military implemented sociopolitical and economic policies on Guam through material and discursive forms of militarism. The impacts of such forced an intertwining of Westernized and traditional ways of life for the CHamoru people, creating a perceived substantial dependence on U.S. structures on the island. In producing asymmetrical opportunities for advancement between American civilians and CHamorus, the U.S. produced the migration of Guam's indigenous inhabitants from the island to the United States.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="infographic-context">
      <h3 class="section-label">Historical Context</h3>
      <div class="section-body">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1898</strong> — Treaty of Paris: Spanish territories, including Guam, ceded to U.S.</li>
          <li><strong>1899</strong> — Establishment of U.S. Naval Government; martial law in effect</li>
          <li><strong>1941–44</strong> — Japanese invasion and American reinvasion</li>
          <li><strong>1950</strong> — The Organic Act naturalizes all CHamorus as U.S. citizens; naval rule ends</li>
          <li><strong>1940s</strong> — First wave of CHamoru military families settle in California</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="infographic-section">
      <h3 class="section-label">Material & Discursive Militarism — Education</h3>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>The early U.S. Naval government appointed military officers and white American civilians as school administrators on the island, whose goal was for CHamoru citizens to "attain the standards of civilization." The marginalization of native teachers went hand-in-hand with increased military control and the Americanization of young students.</p>
        <p><em>[Place your chart or graphic on language fluency, education data, etc. here.]</em></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="infographic-section">
      <h3 class="section-label">Land, Economy & Migration</h3>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>Since the 1890s, many CHamorus experienced the U.S. military taking ancestral land for outpost and facility construction. The economy shifted from subsistence agriculture to American wage employment. The first wave of CHamoru families leaving the island under military jurisdiction was in the 1940s, with greater concentrations near U.S. naval bases along the West Coast.</p>
        <p><em>[Place your charts on land ownership, population distribution, migration, copra export, etc. here.]</em></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="infographic-section">
      <h3 class="section-label">Military Service & Political Status</h3>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>The 1930s marked increasing rates of CHamoru enlistments in the U.S. military. To this day, Guam's political status as an unincorporated U.S. territory limits CHamoru autonomy and rights afforded to other U.S. citizens. Citizens of Guam today fear life without the U.S. military due to perceived threats from Asia, yet their own democracy is compromised in the process of protection.</p>
        <p><em>[Place your graphics on military service, opinions on build-up, etc. here.]</em></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="infographic-conclusion">
      <h3 class="section-label">Conclusion</h3>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>As a result, and according to the data above, CHamorus have sought to reclaim their lives impacted by social and economic conditions of militarism, with the majority migrating to the mainland U.S.—whether on military orders, for higher education, or in search of a better life.</p>
