title: U.S. Militarism on Guam
subtitle: A sample infographic using the assignment structure

introduction: |
  In cementing a foundation of defense in the West Pacific, the U.S. military implemented sociopolitical and economic policies on Guam through material and discursive forms of militarism. The impacts of such forced an intertwining of Westernized and traditional ways of life for the CHamoru people, creating a perceived substantial dependence on U.S. structures on the island. In producing asymmetrical opportunities for advancement between American civilians and CHamorus, the U.S. produced the migration of Guam's indigenous inhabitants from the island to the United States.

historical_context: |
  - **1898** — Treaty of Paris: Spanish territories, including Guam, ceded to U.S.
  - **1899** — Establishment of U.S. Naval Government; martial law in effect
  - **1941–44** — Japanese invasion and American reinvasion
  - **1950** — The Organic Act naturalizes all CHamorus as U.S. citizens; naval rule ends
  - **1940s** — First wave of CHamoru military families settle in California

sections:
  - title: Material & Discursive Militarism — Education
    content: |
      The early U.S. Naval government appointed military officers and white American civilians as school administrators on the island, whose goal was for CHamoru citizens to "attain the standards of civilization." The marginalization of native teachers went hand-in-hand with increased military control and the Americanization of young students.

  - title: Land, Economy & Migration
    content: |
      Since the 1890s, many CHamorus experienced the U.S. military taking ancestral land for outpost and facility construction. The economy shifted from subsistence agriculture to American wage employment. The first wave of CHamoru families leaving the island under military jurisdiction was in the 1940s, with greater concentrations near U.S. naval bases along the West Coast.

  - title: Military Service & Political Status
    content: |
      The 1930s marked increasing rates of CHamoru enlistments in the U.S. military. To this day, Guam's political status as an unincorporated U.S. territory limits CHamoru autonomy and rights afforded to other U.S. citizens. Citizens of Guam today fear life without the U.S. military due to perceived threats from Asia, yet their own democracy is compromised in the process of protection.

conclusion: |
  As a result, and according to the data above, CHamorus have sought to reclaim their lives impacted by social and economic conditions of militarism, with the majority migrating to the mainland U.S.—whether on military orders, for higher education, or in search of a better life.
